This program does Keithley IV measurements using the 6221/2182a stack but does not use the RS-232/Trigger link to connect them to allow for the paired measurements (differential conductance, delta, pulse delta, and pulse delta sweeps) that the dIdV program does. Instead, each instrument is connected to the computer via GPIB and are communicated with separately. The user can perform continuous IV measurement and see a realtime plot (this is not possible with the paired measurements). Data can also be saved to a file of the user's choice.
