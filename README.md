# 6221_2182a_IV
GUI for controlling and collecting DC IV measurements from a Keithley 6221 and 2182a over GPIB

Please note that this is not a finished version. While the code for the LakeShore 336 Temperature Controller is quite functional, the code for the Keithley 6221/2182a stack is not. Additionally, the UI has not been thoroughly tested, and the graphing functionality has not been implemented.
